# Flipper Zero Tools

Welcome to Flipper Hub, your one-stop collection of community-developed tools and scripts for the Flipper Zero platform. This repository aggregates the best “found-on-GitHub” utilities, plugins, and modules—everything from BadUSB payloads and IR/RF remote control emulations to NFC, Bluetooth, GPIO hacks, and beyond. Whether you’re a beginner exploring your first NFC sniffing tool or an advanced user building custom RF protocols, you’ll find curated examples and easy-to-follow instructions to get you up and running quickly.

    BadUSB Payloads: Ready-to-use scripts for USB emulation and keystroke injection.

    IR/RF Remote Controls: Libraries and captures for common TV, air conditioner, and garage door remotes.

    NFC & RFID: Tools for card reading, emulation, and writing (MIFARE, NTAG, etc.).

    Bluetooth LE: Scan, sniff, and interact with BLE peripherals from your Flipper.

    GPIO & Hardware Hacks: Extend your Flipper with custom boards and sensor integrations.

    Community Contributions: A growing list of user-submitted projects—feel free to submit your own!

    Note: Use these tools responsibly and always respect privacy and legal boundaries. Some scripts may require additional hardware or firmware updates—see each tool’s README for prerequisites and usage examples.
